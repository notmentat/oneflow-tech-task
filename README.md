# oneflow-tech-task
A repository for the OneFlow tech task

Very basic setup using Selenium webdriver.
Download Selenium Standalone server, Java selenium client & webdriver language bindings from http://www.seleniumhq.org/download/ and import into Eclipse as project JARs.
Download Chrome Driver from the same URL and ensure it's placed on the system path.
Download the project and right click>run as JUnit test to run.


Note: The register test is currently not re-runable, as it's hard coded to use a username that'll already exist. Needs either database wiping before running or to be tokenised.
